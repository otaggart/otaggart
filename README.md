👋 Hi, I'm Oscar Taggart

🎓 I'm a second-year BSc Computer Science student at the University of Exeter.

💡 I’m especially interested in:
- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- 🎮 Game Design & Development (Unity/C#)

📚 I've worked with languages like Java, Python, C, Haskell, and Prolog. I'm currently working on coursework and side projects that explore machine learning models, backend development, and interactive game design.

🔍 I'm looking for summer internship opportunities in software development, AI/ML, or game programming to gain hands-on experience and contribute to exciting projects.
